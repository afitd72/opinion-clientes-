"I had an amazing stay at this hotel. The room was spacious and clean, and the staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The breakfast buffet was delicious, and the view from our balcony was breathtaking."
"This hotel exceeded all of our expectations. From the warm welcome at the front desk to the impeccable housekeeping, everything was top-notch. The location is perfect for exploring the city and we would absolutely return."
"I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel has a beautiful design and the rooftop pool is a nice touch. The service was friendly and prompt, and I especially appreciated the early check-in that was offered."
"The hotel was fantastic! We stayed for three nights and everything was perfect. The rooms are elegant, the restaurant food was amazing, and every staff member was kind and professional."
What a lovely experience! The hotel is cozy and well-maintained. The bed was extremely comfortable and the concierge gave us great recommendations for restaurants and attractions nearby.
"Unfortunately, my stay was very disappointing. The room was dusty, the sheets looked unwashed, and the bathroom had a persistent foul smell. The front desk was unhelpful when we asked to change rooms."
"This was one of the worst hotel experiences I've had. There was loud construction going on during the day, the Wi-Fi barely worked, and the air conditioning unit made loud noises all night."
"The hotel looked nice online but in reality it was outdated and not well-maintained. The elevator was out of service, the room key didn't work properly, and staff seemed indifferent to complaints."
"My expectations were not met at all. Check-in was delayed, the shower pressure was weak, and the towels were old and stained. Not worth the price I paid."
"Terrible service and even worse facilities. I had to wait almost two hours to get a new room key, and the staff didn’t even apologize. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
"The hotel was fine. Nothing spectacular but not bad either. The room was clean and functional, but lacked charm. Staff was polite, but interactions felt a bit impersonal."
"Average experience overall. The location was good and the check-in process was smooth, but the room decor felt dated. It’s okay for a short business trip."
It’s a standard hotel. You get what you pay for. The amenities were limited but it served the purpose for an overnight stay. Breakfast was decent but not memorable.
"A decent place to sleep, but don’t expect luxury. There’s not much to complain about, but also nothing to rave about. The service was acceptable and the room was fine."
"I had a neutral experience. The hotel provided basic comfort, but nothing stood out. It was neither particularly good nor particularly bad, just average in every way."
"The location of the hotel is excellent and the staff was courteous, but the room was quite small and the walls were thin, making it hard to sleep. Mixed feelings overall."
"I appreciated the free upgrade we received upon arrival, but unfortunately the room had a leaky faucet and the TV didn’t work. Some things were great, others not so much."
"The hotel has potential – it’s well located and the building itself is charming, but the management needs improvement. Service was inconsistent and breakfast ran out early."
"While the lobby and public areas are impressive, the rooms didn’t quite match that standard. Staff tried their best, but the experience was underwhelming."
"It’s a budget-friendly option with some perks like free parking and Wi-Fi, but don’t expect anything luxurious. The room served its purpose for one night."
